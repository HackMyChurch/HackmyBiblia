Prototype of what could be a social network who's main topic is Bible.

Project initialized during hackathon HackmyBible (28 - 30th of september), only as prototype.

As I promised, I've kept developing this project to deliver a functional prototype, as it should have been for pitch... Feel free to make it continue !!
